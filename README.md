The problem at hand revolves around predicting the future price of selected equity stocks, with a specific focus on catering to the needs of swing trading. The motivation for addressing this challenge is rooted in the desire to offer valuable insights to traders and investors. The objective is to assist them in making well-informed decisions, thereby optimizing profits while minimizing risks.
I'm a beginner in the world of trading, particularly in the practice of swing trading. Through my journey, I've come to recognize the stock market as a promising avenue for generating passive income. However, the challenge lies in the considerable time and effort required for continuous research and analysis. Determining the right moments to buy and sell stocks, especially in anticipation of their future prices, demands constant attention and strategic decision-making.
This is where the potential of machine learning becomes truly appealing. Imagine having a smart assistant that, after being trained properly, can forecast the future prices of stocks. For traders like me, this translates to less reliance on guesswork and more informed decision-making. Integrating machine learning into our trading strategies holds the promise of making trading more efficient and profitable. It transforms the stock market from a complex puzzle into a more accessible and reliable source of passive income for individuals navigating the complexities of the trading world.


The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the future price of selected equity stocks, specifically tailored for swing trading. We aim to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions by forecasting stock prices.

Utilizing historical stock price and trading volume data, we will begin with a basic set of features such as open, close, and high prices. The model's initial focus will be on short to medium-term predictions, aligning with the objectives of swing trading.
